# Rock-Paper-Scissors AI-Game

This is a simple and fun rock, paper, scissors game coded in python üêç.

But wait, there is a twist !

Using a very simple algorithm, the code will store the user's previous choices among- rock, paper & scissors, and use it to predict the most probable response ! Thereby, increasing it chances to win. Not only that, this algorithm will be used at random, so sometimes your opponenet(the algorithm) is just randomly making a move, and sometimes its stratergic. So even though this game is not EXACTLY using an Artifical Intelligence, it is still smarter than your average opponent, because it remembers your previous choices!
